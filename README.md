NewsSearchy is a website that attempts to locate biased wording that is typically found in slanted journalism. Enter a webpage with a news article in it, and an e-reader will appear with the article text, along with highlighted text that likely favors either Democrats or Republicans. Since left and right-wing politics are commonly associated with blue and red, the biased language will appear in "shades of red and blue", depending on how much the wording favors either party. NewsSearchy will also point out a certain emotion that the article is trying to evoke, like fear or anger.
